		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			Classic pot roast cooked in a dutch oven on the stove top.  
			Never can remember where the original recipe was found. 
			My family has made this as long as I can remember.
		</p>
		<p>
			Horseradish is not for everyone.  I use a bunch of horseradish
			when I prepare this dish.  It is still great without it.
